    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This one's a simple and easy recipe that I go back to time and again when I want something tasty and fast. What was once just a humble peanut butter and jelly sandwich is now something more gourmet and refined. The awesome thing is that it still only takes about 10-15 minutes to make! This one goes great with a cup of coffee (especially during a late night coding session).</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Peanut butter (either crunchy or smooth)</li>
            <li>Almond butter</li>
            <li>1 medium banana, sliced</li>
            <li>2 slices sprouted wheat bread</li>
            <li>3-4 walnuts (optional)</li>
            <li>Cinnamon (optional)</li>
            <li>Honey or maple syrup (optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread the peanut & almond butter mixture on both slices of bread, and top one half with sliced bananas.</li>
            <li>Chop 3-4 walnuts, and add on top of the banana slices along with a sprinkle of cinnamon and a drizzle of honey</li>
            <li>Top with the other slice of bread (that already has peanut/almond butter spread on it), and place sandwiches in the panini press (or grill sandwiches on a grill pan over medium heat if you do not have a panini press).</li>
            <li>Once the top has browned and sides of the sandwiches are slightly crispy, remove from the sandwich press and let cool for 1-2 min. Cut your gourmet banana peanut butter sandwich in half diagonally and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
