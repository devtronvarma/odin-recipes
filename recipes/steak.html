    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Many folks who enjoy steak don't know that the best way to cook it is actually the opposite of the way it's traditionally done (hence the name of this recipe). In this recipe, we actually cook the steak to its perfect internal temperature first and then sear it to add that nice browned flavor. This recipe takes about 25 minutes of prep time and 25 minutes of cooking time. In this recipe, we go through the steps for those wanting to finish their steaks on the stovetop, but you can also finish these steaks on a grill as well.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Thick-cut beef steak(s), at least 1.5-in to 2-in thick, such as ribeye, strip, porterhouse, etc.</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (if finishing on the stovetop)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter (if finishing on the stovetop)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Generously season steak(s) all over with salt and pepper. If desired, set steak(s) on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight to dry out the exterior. Otherwise, proceed with the next step.</li>
            <li>Set steak(s) on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Preheat oven to anywhere between 200 and 275°F (93 and 135°C); if your oven goes lower, you can set it to an even lower temperature, though it will take longer to cook. </li>
            <li>Place steak(s) in the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 105°F (41°C) for rare, 115°F (46°C) for medium-rare, 125°F (52°C) for medium, or 135°F (57°C) for medium-well. This will take about 20 minutes for rare steak and up to about 40 minutes for medium-well; cooking time can vary dramatically depending on many factors, so check often. </li>
            <li>Just before steak(s) come out of the oven, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil to a cast iron, carbon steel, or heavy stainless steel skillet and heat over high heat until smoking. Add steak(s) and butter to skillet and cook until each side is well browned, about 45 seconds per side. Using tongs, hold steak(s) sideways to sear edges. Serve right away; there's no need to let reverse-seared steaks rest. </li>
