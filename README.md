# Odin Recipes: A Basic Recipes Website

## Intro
This is the first project in The Odin Project's Foundations of Web Development path, and it's focused on helping me practice basic HTML markup and proper git workflows. The website will consist of a main index page and a few links to a few recipes. It's not meant to look pretty (yet) -- it's just an attempt to build my HTML chops.
